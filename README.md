Perfect — here's your complete, **professional README documentation** for your Employee Directory project. It's written as per best GitHub standards and reflects everything you've built so far:

---

# 📘 Employee Directory Web App

A responsive, interactive, and modular **Employee Directory** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Freemarker templates** (mocked for client-side).
This project simulates a real-world employee management interface and is structured for both local and Java backend integration (via Freemarker).

## 📦 Setup & Run Locally

### 🛠 Requirements:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for local server via `serve`)
* Any static server (optional: Java Freemarker backend for full server-side rendering)

### 🧪 Run Locally (Client-Only Mode):

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve .
```

Then open: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 🔄 Data Handling

* Uses a mock employee array seeded into `localStorage` on first load.
* All edits persist locally in the browser.
* Data is rendered dynamically using JavaScript and templated markup (compatible with Freemarker).

---

## ✨ Core Modules Breakdown

### 📄 `index.ftlh` (Dashboard)

* Lists employees as responsive cards
* Includes search bar, filter UI, and sort options
* Pagination support
* Buttons for Edit / Delete

### 📝 `form.ftlh` (Add/Edit)

* Reusable form for both adding and editing employees
* Pre-fills data when editing
* Validates inputs like name, email, role, etc.

### 📜 `layout.ftlh`

* Shared layout structure (header, wrapper)
* Used via Freemarker `<@layout> ... </@layout>` syntax

---

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

You can add screenshots here of:

* Dashboard view
* Filter/sort/search in action
* Form validation
* Pagination navigation
* Mobile layout

## 🙌 Reflection

### ✅ What Went Well

* Modular code with clean separation of concerns
* Full functionality without backend
* Works both locally and on deployment
* Freemarker-compatible templates structured for backend extension

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* Routing issues on deployment (fixed via relative paths)
* Managing pagination and filtering interplay
* Handling initial state where `localStorage` is empty

### 🔁 What I'd Improve

* Add full Freemarker + Java backend for production integration
* Use IndexedDB or backend DB for persistent storage
* Add image upload, CSV export, and login system

---

## ✅ Deployment

Deployed via GitHub Pages:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create employee-directory --public --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin main
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (`branch: main`, `/root`)
